# How to contribute

* If you have a digital copy of a textbook not listed here, a solutions manual, or a comprehensive study guide, or you want to report a dead link please get in touch

* You can contact us by sending a private message to /u/SBUTextbooks on reddit by clicking [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SBUTextbooks). If you don't have a reddit account, it only takes a second to sign up. You don't even need to give your email.

* The preferred method is for you to upload the pdf(s) to mega.nz. Then, right click the file, click "get link", **click "link with key"**, then send me the link using the instructions above. If you send us the link without clicking "link with key", people will not be able to open your file. Plenty of people who have attempted to contribute have made this mistake. Also, in your message include the:
 1. title
 2. edition (or year published if it doesn't have one)
 3. author(s)' last names
 4. course code it's used for

Thanks!
